# UI_Vaja_3
2nd year - Neural Net for recognizing hand-drawn numbers

TO RUN A SIMPLE EXAMPLE: 
  1. Run the program
  2. Underneath the popped up window make sure the "example_of_1_and_2.txt" next to DIRECT TRAIN is selected
  3. Press DIRECT TRAIN and wait for the "NOT HERE!" text to change to "HERE"
  4. Press the GUESS button and draw either the number 1 or 2. Only these are trained in this set
  5. Wait for the text "GUESSING..." to display a guess in the form of "MY GUESS IS:"
  
The implemented functionalities are: 
  - Creating a new dataset
  - Direct training (training from an existing file)
  - Vectorization and Deletion - the canvas can be drawn on to test its vectorization functionality
